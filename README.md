# Overview

At the beginning of my third semester of BYU-Idaho I started to take a C++ class with my friend, but we quickly realized that the instructor hadn't finished preparing the material.
We were having a hard time with the class due to his structure and material, we decided to drop the class and take it at a later time.
Before taking it again I decided to try and learn some of the material on my own, which resulted in this program.
I decided to use opengl so I could have some visuals, it's so much more satisfying to have a program work that gives you something to look at.
The goal is to display a checkered grid, eventually I would like to implement my pathfinder algorithm design.
I didn't have a ton of time but wanted some experience with classes so I made your basic car class just to get some experience with that in.
I need to better understand how Visual Studio works, I have hardly used it.

# Development Environment

This project was made in Visual Studio with C++, open GL was used for the GUI.
